The **NRGkick** {% term integration %} allows you to integrate your [NRGkick Gen2 mobile wallbox](https://www.nrgkick.com/en/) into Home Assistant. It uses the official local REST JSON API to communicate with the device.

## Prerequisites

To use this integration, your NRGkick device must meet the following requirements:

- **NRGkick Gen2** (Smart Cable)
- **Firmware**: SmartModule firmware 4.0.0.0 or newer
- **Local Network**: The device must be connected to the same local network as Home Assistant.
- **JSON API**: The JSON API must be enabled in the NRGkick App:
  1. Open the NRGkick app.
  2. Go to **Extended** > **Local API**.
  3. Enable **JSON API**.
  4. (Optional) Enable **Authentication (JSON)** and set a username and password.

## Configuration

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

### Configuration options

The integration offers the following options:

{% configuration_basic %}
Scan Interval:
description: "How often to poll the device for updates (10-300 seconds). Default is 30 seconds."
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

## Supported functionality

The integration provides a wide range of entities to monitor and control your charging session.

### Sensors

- **Power & Energy**: Active power (total/phase), session energy, total energy, voltage, current.
- **Status**: Charging status, error codes, implementation status.
- **Temperatures**: Housing temperature, connector temperatures (if supported by attachment).
- **Network**: Wi-Fi signal/SSID, IP address.
- **GPS & Cellular**: (SIM models only) Location data and cellular connection status.

### Binary sensors

- **Charging**: Indicates if the vehicle is currently charging.
- **Charge Permitted**: Indicates if charging is allowed by the device (e.g., not blocked by schedule).
- **Charge Pause**: Indicates if charging is manually paused.

### Switch

- **Charge Pause**: Allows you to pause and resume charging manually.
  - **On**: Charging is paused.
  - **Off**: Charging is active (or ready to charge).

### Numbers

- **Charging Current**: Set the charging current limit (6A - 32A).
- **Energy Limit**: Set a limit for the energy to be charged in the current session (Wh). 0 means unlimited.
- **Phase Count**: (If supported) Number of phases to use (1-3).

## Troubleshooting

### Device not found

If the automatic discovery does not find your device:

- Ensure the device is powered and connected to the Wi-Fi.
- Verify that **JSON API** is enabled in the NRGkick app.
- Check if the device is on the same network subnet as Home Assistant.
- Try adding the device manually using its IP address.

### Sensors not updating

- Check the **Scan Interval** in the integration options.
- Verify the network connection to the device.
- Some sensors (like Phase 2/3 voltage) only report data when active on a 3-phase connection.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal.
